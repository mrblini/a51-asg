        As AIs, robots and other electronic tech become increasingly capable, there's a risk it turns into a kind of alien intelligence that people can't relate to.    

But there is a better path: give our devices personalities.  Give them expressive faces.   Integrate them with interactive characters that we can relate to and genuinely share with.

The Area51 Framework provides a new and powerful toolset for exchange of information between people and AI-powered interactive virtual characters.  We're talking intelligent synthetic personalities, digital influencers, virtual companions, synthespians ... personality-driven UX experiences for hardware and software....

<!--  -->
The Area51 Framework provides 

•	ontology for representing information regarding a human user's personality, experience, social interactions, emotions and behavior
•	AI tools for using information about an individual and their situation to guide the behavior of a virtual character
•	A semantic communication protocol for interaction between humans and virtual characters.  
•	A token-based ecosystem for compensating people for use of the data generated through their interactions with virtual characters, and regulating access to advanced features of virtual characters

These ingredients work together to enable an audience-centric approach to bring personality and intelligence to a variety of entertainment, technology, and business applications.

The Area51 token will be used for multiple purposes, including

•	purchasing upgrades and additional features for virtual characters
•	receiving compensation for use of the data and knowledge you impart to a virtual character and participating in virtual influencer activities and other crowd-sourced activities. 
•	paying Virtual Influencers for their exploits, similarly to how you pay Twitch-streamers for theirs.

To demonstrate and leverage this new framework the Area51 team is creating a first generation of AI friends that we like to think of as “alien lifeforms” created right here on earth.  These Area51 personalities are designed not just to be Alexa or Siri style interfaces to your digital lifestyle, but friends and companions who are there for you whenever you need them. 

These initial Area51 AI friends take the form of warm, friendly space aliens, conversant with human language and emotion -- putting an empathic face on the ever-changing, post-human world of modern computers, data services, networks and AI algorithms.  
 
Area51 is designed to interoperate closely with the SingularityNET decentralized AI platform and the Ocean decentralized data platform, and in general to support interoperability with a variety of blockchain-based computing networks.   In particular, the AI functionalities required by the first-generation Area51 characters will be derived via AI agents running in the SingularityNET platform, via back-end automated conversion of Area51 and SingularityNET AGI tokens.  Never before has the power of sophisticated blockchain-based AI and data architectures been deployed for the purpose of creating entertaining, useful and lifelike virtual characters.
